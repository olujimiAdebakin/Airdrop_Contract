# Merkle Airdrop Smart Contract üíé

## Overview
This project implements a secure and efficient gasless airdrop mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It leverages Merkle trees for efficient whitelist management and EIP-712 signatures for delegated transaction execution, ensuring users can claim tokens without directly paying gas fees. Developed with Foundry, it includes a custom ERC20 token and comprehensive scripting for deployment, Merkle tree generation, and user interaction.

## Features
- **Gasless Airdrop**: Allows third parties (relay servers or designated accounts) to pay for transaction fees on behalf of recipients.
- **Merkle Tree Verification**: Utilizes a Merkle tree to efficiently verify recipient eligibility against a whitelist, minimizing on-chain data storage.
- **EIP-712 Signature Authentication**: Incorporates EIP-712 typed data signatures for secure, off-chain authorization of claim requests, preventing unauthorized claims.
- **Custom ERC20 Token**: Includes `AirBucksToken.sol`, a simple ERC20 token that can be minted by its owner.
- **Anti-Double Claiming**: Prevents addresses from claiming more than once through on-chain tracking.
- **Foundry Toolchain Integration**: Full development, testing, and deployment suite built with Foundry, ensuring robust smart contract development.
- **Automated Scripting**: Provides scripts for generating Merkle tree inputs, building the tree and proofs, and deploying and interacting with the contracts.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To set up and run this project locally, you will need to install Foundry.

1.  üì• **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/Airdrop_Contract.git
    cd Airdrop_Contract
    ```

2.  üõ†Ô∏è **Install Foundry**:
    If you don't have Foundry installed, follow the official instructions:
    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
    ```

3.  üì¶ **Install Project Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Solidity libraries:
    ```bash
    forge install
    ```

4.  ‚öôÔ∏è **Compile Contracts**:
    Compile the smart contracts to ensure everything is set up correctly:
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```

### Environment Variables
While no specific `.env` file is explicitly required by the provided Solidity code, for deployment and interaction with a live network, you will typically need the following environment variables. Create a `.env` file in your project root if interacting with external networks.

-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet's private key (e.g., `0xabcdef123...`). **Warning: Never expose your private keys.**
-   `RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the blockchain network you wish to deploy to (e.g., `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY`).

```dotenv
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
RPC_URL="your_rpc_url_here"
```

## Usage

This project provides a comprehensive set of Foundry scripts to facilitate the entire airdrop process, from preparing the whitelist to deployment and claiming.

### 1. Generating Airdrop Inputs
The `GenerateInput.s.sol` script prepares a JSON file (`input.json`) containing the whitelist of addresses and their respective airdrop amounts. This file serves as the input for generating the Merkle tree.

To run the script:
```bash
forge script script/GenerateInput.s.sol --broadcast
```
This will create a `input.json` file in `script/target/`.

### 2. Building the Merkle Tree & Proofs
The `MakeMerkle.s.sol` script reads the `input.json` generated in the previous step, computes the Merkle root, and generates a Merkle proof for each whitelisted address. The output is saved to `output.json`.

To run the script:
```bash
forge script script/MakeMerkle.s.sol --broadcast
```
This will create an `output.json` file in `script/target/`. This file will contain the Merkle root and individual proofs, essential for users to claim.

### 3. Deploying the Contracts
The `DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol` script handles the deployment of both the `AirBucksToken` and `MerkleAirdrop` contracts. It also mints tokens to the deployer and transfers the total airdrop amount to the `MerkleAirdrop` contract, making them available for claiming.

To deploy to a local Anvil instance:
```bash
anvil & # Start an Anvil node in the background
forge script script/DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974... # Use Anvil's default private key
```
To deploy to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia):
```bash
forge script script/DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```
Replace `$RPC_URL`, `$PRIVATE_KEY`, and `$ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` with your actual environment variables.

### 4. Claiming the Airdrop
The `Interact.s.sol` script demonstrates how a recipient can claim their airdrop tokens. **Crucially, the `SIGNATURE` variable in `script/Interact.s.sol` must be replaced with a valid EIP-712 signature generated off-chain for the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` and `CLAIMING_AMOUNT`**.

An EIP-712 signature is typically generated by an off-chain application (e.g., a web DApp or a backend service) using the `getMessageHash` function of the `MerkleAirdrop` contract. The signed message digest is then recovered on-chain using `ECDSA.recover` to verify the signer's identity.

**Before running `Interact.s.sol`:**
1.  Identify the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` and `CLAIMING_AMOUNT` you wish to test.
2.  Obtain the Merkle proof for that address from the `output.json` generated by `MakeMerkle.s.sol`.
3.  Generate an EIP-712 signature off-chain for the specific `account` and `amount` using the `MerkleAirdrop` contract's `domain separator` and `type hash`. This typically involves a user signing a message in their wallet.
4.  Update the `SIGNATURE` variable in `script/Interact.s.sol` with the generated signature.

To run the claim script (assuming contracts are deployed and `SIGNATURE` is updated):
```bash
forge script script/Interact.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974... # Use Anvil's default private key
```

### 5. Running Tests
All smart contract tests are written using Foundry's `forge test` framework.
To run the tests:
```bash
forge test
```

## Smart Contract Interface

### Deployed Contracts
After deployment, the `AirBucksToken` and `MerkleAirdrop` contracts will reside at specific addresses on the blockchain. You can find these addresses in the console output of the `DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol` script.

### Public Functions

#### `AirBucksToken.constructor()`
Initializes the ERC20 token with "AirBucks" as its name and "ABUCKS" as its symbol, setting the deployer as the contract owner.

-   **Parameters**: None

#### `AirBucksToken.mint(address to, uint256 amount)`
Mints new `amount` of AirBucks tokens and transfers them to the `to` address. Only callable by the contract owner.

-   **Parameters**:
    -   `to` (address): The address to receive the minted tokens.

-   **Errors**:
    -   `Ownable: caller is not the owner`: If a non-owner attempts to call this function.

#### `MerkleAirdrop.constructor(bytes32 merkleRoot, IERC20 airdropToken)`

    -   `MerkleAirdrop_AlreadyClaimed`: If the `account` has already successfully claimed.
    -   `MerkleAirdrop_InvalidProof`: If the provided Merkle proof does not verify against the contract's Merkle root.

#### `MerkleAirdrop.getMessageHash(address account, uint256 amount)`
Calculates the EIP-712 typed data hash for an airdrop claim message. This hash should be signed off-chain by the `account`.
